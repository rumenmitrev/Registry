DroneDB Registry is a simple, user-friendly aerial data management and storage application. It features JWT authentication and implements a full REST API. 

Combined with [Hub](https://github.com/DroneDB/Hub), it provides a simple, fast and reliable platform for hosting and sharing geospatial images and data.
It also allows you to view orthophotos and point clouds easily and effortlessly directly in the browser.

### Orthophoto and flight path

## Getting started

To get started, you need to install the following applications (if they are not installed already):

  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Single command startup:

### Linux

```bash
mkdir ddb-registry && cd ddb-registry && \ 
  curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DroneDB/Registry/master/docker/testing/docker-compose.yml && \
  curl -o appsettings-testing.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DroneDB/Registry/master/docker/testing/appsettings-testing.json && \
  curl -o initialize.sql https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DroneDB/Registry/master/docker/testing/initialize.sql && \
  docker-compose up -d
```

### Windows (powershell)

```powershell
mkdir ddb-registry; cd ddb-registry; `
curl -O docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DroneDB/Registry/master/docker/testing/docker-compose.yml; `
curl -O appsettings-testing.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DroneDB/Registry/master/docker/testing/appsettings-testing.json; `
curl -O initialize.sql https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DroneDB/Registry/master/docker/testing/initialize.sql; `
docker-compose up -d
```

> **_NOTE:_**  This configuration is for local testing only: **DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION**. If you want to use the application in production check the following section.

This command will start a new stack composed by 
 - MariaDB database
 - PHPMyAdmin, exposed on port [8080](http://localhost:8080)
 - Registry, exposed on port [5000](http://localhost:5000)

Default username and password are `admin` and `password`. After logging in you can check the status of the application by visiting [/quickhealth](http://localhost:5000/quickhealth). The [/health](http://localhost:5000/health) endpoint gives more in-depth information.

You can follow the logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

In order to update the application

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

Registry supports Swagger API documentation on [/swagger](http://localhost:5000/swagger/) and Hangfire as task runner on [/hangfire](http://localhost:5000/hangfire/).

### Change admin password

You can change the admin password by changing the value of the field `DefaultAdmin.Password` in the `appsettings.json` file. After changing the password you need to restart the application.

## Running in production

You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Clone the repo and initialize submodules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DroneDB/Registry
cd Registry
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

And then run the following commands:

### Linux

```bash
cd docker/production
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

### Windows

```bash
cd docker/production
run.bat
```

Check that everything is running smoothly:

```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f
```

When all the containers are running, you can then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser, use `admin:password` as default credentials.

You can stop the application by issuing:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

The `run.sh` / `run.bat` script will create the default `appsettings.json` file, the database initialization script and start the Docker containers.

It is possible to customize the startup settings by creating a `.env` file in the same folder. Here's an example:

### Linux (quotes are important)
```bash
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="default-root-password"
MYSQL_PASSWORD="default-mysql-password"
REGISTRY_ADMIN_MAIL="test@test.it"
REGISTRY_ADMIN_PASSWORD="password"
REGISTRY_SECRET="longandrandomsecrettobegeneratedusingcryptographicallystrongrandomnumbergenerator"
EXTERNAL_URL=""
CONTROL_SWITCH='$controlSwitch'
```

### Windows (values without quotes)
```batch
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=default-root-password
MYSQL_PASSWORD=default-mysql-password
REGISTRY_ADMIN_MAIL=test@test.it
REGISTRY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
REGISTRY_SECRET=longandrandomsecrettobegeneratedusingcryptographicallystrongrandomnumbergenerator
EXTERNAL_URL=
CONTROL_SWITCH=$controlSwitch
```

If you want to reduce the log verbosity, you can change `"Information"` to `"Warning"` in `appsettings.json`:

```json
    "LevelSwitches": {
        "$CONTROL_SWITCH": "Warning"
    }
```

then run

```
docker-compose restart registry
````

> **_Info:_** Any changes to the configuration file need to restart the registry container  


## Standalone installation with docker (only for testing)

The following steps start a new instance of `registry` with the default configuration and `SQLite` as backend database. They work both on linux and windows (powershell):

```bash
wget -O appsettings.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DroneDB/Registry/master/Registry.Web/appsettings-default.json

docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 -v ${PWD}/registry-data:/Registry/App_Data -v ${PWD}/appsettings.json:/Registry/appsettings.json dronedb/registry:latest
```

> `Registry` can use `SQLite`, `MySQL` (`MariaDB`) or `SQL Server` as a database. Nevertheless, the application is primarily designed to be used with `MariaDB`. There are no migration scripts for the other databases, so you have to manually upgrade the schema between versions. The above steps are for test only, and should not be used in production.

## Build Docker image

If you want to build the image from scratch, you can use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DroneDB/Registry
cd Registry
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build . -t dronedb/registry
```

Notes:
- `ddb` commands must use the `127.0.0.1` syntax, not `localhost`

## Building Natively

`Registry` is written in C# on .NET Core 6 platform and runs natively on both Linux and Windows.
To install the latest .NET SDK see the [official download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0). Before building registry ensure you have `ddblib` in your path, if not, download the [latest release](https://github.com/DroneDB/DroneDB/releases) and add it to `PATH`.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DroneDB/Registry
cd Registry
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build the solution from the command line:

```bash
dotnet build
```

Run the tests to make sure the project is working correctly:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Then build the Hub interface (need [NodeJS 14+](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v14.18.3/)):

```bash
cd Registry.Web/ClientApp
npm install -g webpack@4
npm install
webpack
```

## Running Natively

On the first start `Registry` will create an `appsettings.json` file with default values. Feel free to modify it to your needs following the [documentation](https://docs.dronedb.app/registry).

```bash
dotnet run --project Registry.Web
```

It will start a web server listening on two endpoints: `https://localhost:5001` and `http://localhost:5000`. 
You can change the endpoints using the `urls` parameter:

```bash
dotnet run --project Registry.Web --urls="http://0.0.0.0:6000;https://0.0.0.0:6001"
```
